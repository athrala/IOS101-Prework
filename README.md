## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Threads: clean interface, only shows contents from people I followed
2. Instagram: translation, option to switch to a private account
3. Starbucks: personalized offer, treat friends
4. Language learning app based on Duolingo: Duolingo currently has fixed lecture content for everyone. Implementing OpenAIâ€™s
   GPT-4 technology could attract more users by offering a personalized learning experience. Some features could be real-time
   feedback powered by GPT-4, conversational practice, and personalized vocabulary lists that suit users' professions, passions,
   or hobbies.
## Notes
